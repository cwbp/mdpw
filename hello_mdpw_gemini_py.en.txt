Please create a Python virtual environment (venv) here and install the mdpw package.
Here is an example of how to use mdpw:

import mdpw
a = ['s', ['n', 64, 1, 64, 1], ['n', 68, 1, 64, 1], ['n', 71, 1, 64, 1],
         ['c', ['n', 64, 1, 64, 1], ['n', 68, 1, 64, 1], ['n', 71, 1, 64, 1]],
         ['c', ['s', ['n', 64, 1, 64, 1], ['n', 68, 1, 64, 1], ['n', 71, 1, 64, 1],
              ['s', ['n', 68, 2, 64], ['n', 71], ['n', 75]]]]]
mdpw.compile(a, 120).write("hello.mid")
The array must start with one of the following: 'n', 's', or 'c'.
Arrays starting with 'n' represent a note. The next values are pitch, duration, and velocity.
If duration or velocity is omitted, the most recent value is reused.
Rests are represented as notes with velocity 0.
Arrays starting with 's' represent a sequence start.
Arrays starting with 'c' represent chords. Chords can be nested.
mdpw.compile(a, 120) generates a MIDI file at 120 BPM.
.write("hello.mid") saves it to a file.

Please create a script that generates the melody:
"c-cdeeg-eeddc-r-"

In this melody:
Notes followed by - are of duration 1.
Notes without - are of duration 0.5.
r indicates a rest.

Install pygame so that I can play MIDI files from the command line.
And play the generated MIDI file using pygame.
