Please create a venv environment here and install mdpw.

An example of how to use mdpw is as follows:
```python
import mdpw
a = ['s',['n',64,1,64,1],['n',68,1,64,1],['n',71,1,64,1],
         ['c',['n',64,1,64,1],['n',68,1,64,1],['n',71,1,64,1]],
         ['c',['s',['n',64,1,64,1],['n',68,1,64,1],['n',71,1,64,1],
              ['s',['n',68,2,64],['n',71],['n',75]]]]]
mdpw.compile(a, 120).write("hello.mid")
```

The beginning of an array must be 'n', 's', or 'c'.
An array starting with 'n' represents a note, followed by pitch, duration, velocity, and timbre. If values after duration are omitted, the values from the previous note are used. Rests are represented as notes with velocity 0.
An array starting with 's' represents playing in sequence. This array can be nested.
An array starting with 'c' represents playing simultaneously. This array can be nested too.
`mdpw.compile(a, 120)` generates a MIDI file at 120 bpm.
`write("hello.mid")` saves it to a file.

Please install pygame to the venv so that MIDI files can be played from the command line with Python.

Please create a melody of "CDEFEDCN" and call it Melody A. "N" is a rest. Please create a MIDI file for Melody A and play it.

Please raise all "C D E F" of Melody A to "E F G A" respectively and call it Melody B. Please create a MIDI file for Melody B and play it.

Melody C is "C-C-C-C-". "-" means the duration is 2. Please create a MIDI file for Melody C and play it.

Please change the notes of Melody A up to "F" from quarter notes to two eighth notes, leaving the rest unchanged, and call it Melody D. Please create a MIDI file for Melody D and play it.

Connecting Melody A, Melody B, Melody C, and Melody D will be the entire melody. Please create a MIDI file for the entire melody and play it.

Please create a three-part round of the entire melody, shifted by the length of Melody A, create a MIDI file, and play it.
